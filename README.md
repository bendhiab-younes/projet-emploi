# Projet-Emplois - College Class Schedule Management Web Application

Projet-Emplois is a college project developed by a group of classmates aimed at managing college class schedules for both students and professors. 
While the project is not 100% complete and requires some fixes in the implementation part, it received a satisfactory mark of 17/20.

## Project Description

The primary goal of the Projet-Emplois web application is to provide a convenient and efficient way to manage college class schedules. 
This project incorporates various technologies and methodologies to achieve this objective.

## Tasks

### Design and Prototyping

- Using Figma, we created templates for the web application to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing design.

### UML Diagrams

We elaborated two key UML diagrams to guide the project's development:

1. **General Use Case Diagram:** 
This diagram outlines the various use cases and interactions within the system, helping us understand how users and components would interact with the application.

2. **General Class Diagram:** 
The class diagram provides a structural view of the application, illustrating the key classes and their relationships.

### Database Design

Using MySQL, we designed and implemented the database structure to store essential information for managing college class schedules, 
including details about students, professors, courses, classrooms, labs, sessions, and timetables.

### Web Application Development

We established a web application using Symfony, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

#### Key functionalities of the web app include:

- Admins can add students, professors, courses, classrooms, labs, sessions, and timelines to the database to create class schedules.
- Users, such as students and professors, can log in to the web app to access their respective class schedules.
- Professors can also check the availability of empty classrooms and labs at specific hours or sessions.

## Project Result

Despite the project not being fully completed, it received a satisfactory mark of 17/20. However, there are still some fixes needed in the implementation part.
